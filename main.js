                7. Right-of-Way Rules:
                Yield to aircraft in distress.
                Aircraft being overtaken has the right of way.
                Converging aircraft: The aircraft on the right has the right of way.
                Powered aircraft yield to balloons, gliders, and airships.
                8. Key Limitations:
                VFR flight not allowed above FL180 (Class A airspace).
                Special VFR (SVFR) may be requested to operate in controlled airspace below VFR minimums (must remain clear of clouds).`,
                
                'IFR rules': `
                1. Basic Requirements:
                Purpose: IFR is used when visual navigation is not possible, such as in low visibility or poor weather conditions.
                Flight Plan: A filed and approved IFR flight plan is mandatory before operating under IFR.
                Clearance: Pilots must receive ATC clearance to operate under IFR.
                2. Weather Minimums:
                No Visual Reference Required: IFR flights can be conducted in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as clouds, fog, or other conditions below VFR weather minimums.
                Approach Minimums: Specific weather conditions for instrument approaches are based on published approach plates (e.g., decision height, visibility).
                3. Equipment Requirements (FAR 91.205): The following equipment is required for IFR flight:
                VFR Equipment: All instruments and equipment required for VFR flight.
                Navigation Instruments:
                Two-way radio communication.
                Navigation equipment suitable for the route and approach (e.g., VOR, GPS).
                Additional Instruments:
                Gyroscopic pitch and bank indicator (attitude indicator).
                Gyroscopic direction indicator (heading indicator).
                Slip-skid indicator.
                Sensitive altimeter adjustable for barometric pressure.
                Clock with sweep-second hand or digital equivalent.
                Generator or alternator.
                Gyroscopic turn and bank indicator.
                4. Clearance Requirements:
                Clearance Delivery: ATC clearance is required before entering controlled airspace under IFR.
                Route Compliance: Follow the route and altitude as specified in the clearance.
                Amendments: Notify ATC of deviations due to weather or emergencies.
                5. Altitude Rules:
                Assigned Altitudes: Fly the altitude assigned by ATC.
                Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA): Fly no lower than the MEA on published routes.
                Off Route: Maintain at least 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous areas) above obstacles within 4 nautical miles of course.
                6. Instrument Approaches:
                Types of Approaches:
                Precision Approaches (e.g., ILS): Provides lateral and vertical guidance.
                Non-Precision Approaches (e.g., VOR, RNAV): Provides lateral guidance only.
                Decision Altitude (DA)/Decision Height (DH): Point at which a landing decision must be made during a precision approach.
                Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA): The lowest altitude to descend during a non-precision approach until visual contact is made.
                7. Lost Communication Procedures (FAR 91.185): If radio communication is lost:
                Route: Follow the last assigned route, expected route, or as filed in your flight plan (in that order).
                Altitude: Fly the highest of:
                -Last assigned altitude.
                -Minimum enroute altitude (MEA).
                -Expected altitude.
                8. Holding Patterns:
                Follow standard ATC instructions or published holding patterns.
                Standard Turns: Right-hand turns are standard unless otherwise specified.
                9. Alternate Airport Requirements:
                IFR flights require an alternate airport in the flight plan unless specific conditions are met:
                Destination has at least 2,000-foot ceilings and 3 SM visibility within 1 hour of ETA.
                10. Key Safety Practices:
                Scan Instruments: Maintain situational awareness through regular instrument scanning.
                ATC Communication: Maintain constant communication and promptly respond to instructions.
                Currency: Pilots must meet instrument proficiency requirements (e.g., six instrument approaches, holding procedures, and tracking within the last six months).`,

                Control: Strictly controlled and requires ATC (Air Traffic Control) clearance for all aircraft operations.
                Flight Rules: Only IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) are permitted.
                Communication: Continuous two-way communication with ATC is mandatory.
                Usage: Primarily for commercial airline routes and high-altitude flights.
                2. Class B (Terminal airspace around major airports)
                Altitude: Extends from the surface up to 10,000 feet MSL, surrounding major airports.
                Control: Also highly controlled; ATC clearance is required to enter and operate within this airspace.
                Flight Rules: VFR (Visual Flight Rules) and IFR are allowed, but VFR flights need to obtain ATC permission before entry.
                Communication: Continuous two-way communication with ATC is required.
                Usage: Primarily around busy, large airports like Los Angeles (LAX), Chicago O'Hare (ORD), etc.
                3. Class C (Controlled airspace around airports)
                Altitude: From the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation.
                Control: Requires ATC communication to enter; VFR pilots must establish two-way communication with ATC before entering.
                Flight Rules: Both VFR and IFR can operate, but communication with ATC is necessary for VFR operations.
                Communication: Two-way communication is required for VFR flights entering Class C.
                Usage: Typically used for airports with moderate traffic, such as regional airports.
                4. Class D (Controlled airspace around smaller airports)
                Altitude: From the surface up to around 2,500 feet above the airport elevation.
                Control: ATC clearance is required to enter and operate within Class D airspace, but the communication requirement is only for IFR flights.
                Flight Rules: VFR flights are allowed without ATC clearance but must establish communication with ATC before entering.
                Communication: Two-way communication is required before entering or operating in Class D.
                Usage: Smaller regional airports with moderate traffic.
                5. Class E (Controlled airspace for non-towered areas)
                Altitude: It extends from 1,200 feet AGL (Above Ground Level) up to 18,000 feet MSL and also includes some airspace surrounding airports and along certain airways.
                Control: Class E airspace is controlled airspace but can be used for both VFR and IFR flights.
                Flight Rules: Both VFR and IFR are allowed, but IFR flights are given priority for ATC services.
                Communication: Communication with ATC is only required under IFR.
                Usage: Class E is common in areas where there are fewer commercial air traffic routes or in areas where no other controlled airspace is needed.
                6. Class G (Uncontrolled airspace)
                Altitude: From the surface up to 1,200 feet AGL in some areas, and in some remote locations, it can extend up to 14,500 feet AGL.
                Control: Class G airspace is uncontrolled, meaning ATC does not provide services, although IFR flights must still follow certain rules.
                Flight Rules: VFR is typically allowed without ATC communication, but IFR flights must remain in contact with ATC.
                Communication: No communication with ATC is required for VFR flights.
                Usage: This airspace is used primarily in rural and less-traveled areas.`,

                'Go around procedures': `1) Announce the Go-Around
                Verbalize: "Go-Around" to notify crew or ATC.
                Communicate: Inform ATC (e.g., "Going around, [call sign]") if in controlled airspace.
                2) Apply Full Power
                Smoothly and promptly advance the throttle to full power.
                Ensure propeller and mixture are set appropriately (for piston engines).
                3) Pitch for Climb Attitude
                Establish Positive Climb: Adjust pitch to achieve the appropriate climb attitude 
                Monitor the airspeed to avoid stalling.
                4) Retract Flaps Gradually
                Retract flaps incrementally as airspeed increases, following manufacturer guidelines.
                Avoid retracting flaps all at once, which could lead to a loss of lift.
                5) Ensure Positive Rate of Climb
                Verify Vertical Speed: Ensure the aircraft is climbing by checking the VSI or altimeter.
                Gear Up: If applicable, retract the landing gear after confirming a positive rate of climb.
                6) Stabilize the Aircraft
                Maintain a consistent climb at a safe airspeed (e.g., Vy for best climb rate).
                Stay aligned with the runway centerline or follow ATC instructions for missed approach procedures.
                7) Communicate with ATC (if required)
                Inform ATC of the go-around and request further instructions. For example:
                "Missed approach, climbing to [altitude], heading [heading], [call sign]."
                8) Follow Missed Approach Procedure
                If operating under IFR or at a controlled airport, execute the published missed approach procedure.
                If VFR, reposition for another approach or leave the traffic pattern as appropriate.
                9) Assess and Plan Next Steps
                Analyze the reason for the go-around (e.g., unstable approach, obstruction on the runway, ATC instruction, etc.).
                Decide whether to attempt another landing, divert to an alternate airport, or hold for further instructions.`
