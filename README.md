# GeoFS-All-in-one-Addon
NOTE: A massive update has just been made, allowing the tampermonkey scripts to run as normal scripts without GM functions. Running the bookmarklet or main.js will have full functionality of the tampermonkey scripts. Also, the addon GeoFS-Chat-Fix has been added, AI ATC now has a toggle so that pressing D can either open the text or voice input, and pressing [/] now toggles autothrottle. Joystick support has also been added to autoland++. See instructions for further details.
Born out of my obsession with having all the addons I could ever need in one place, this addon contains 26 addons, their instructions, and detailed flight procedures, compiled together. <br/>
 -Several of the addons have received some kind of modification/update to ensure full functionality, and to make sure they can run well together <br/>
-If you would like the un-compressed version of one of the scripts, open an issue or ping me on discord (@geofs_pilot_09286) <br/>

## How to use:
Note: depending on the size of your screen, everything might not fit on the UI bar. If this happens, simply zoom out the site (ctrl-). Some of the scripts included need Tampermonkey, so I recommend using that method, but if you really don't want to, you can inject the script into the console. 
### Console
#### Bookmarklet
-Bookmark any page, left click on it, press Edit, and replace the URL with the contents of bookmarklet.js <br/>
-Run the script **BEFORE** GeoFS loads. You will have to do this every time you open GeoFS. <br/>
-No need to update, automatically runs latest version <br/>
#### Pasting into console
-Press F12/Ctrl+shift+I/Ctrl+shift+J and go to the Console tab. <br/>
-Paste in the contents of main.js at the > symbol **BEFORE** GeoFS loads and hit Enter <br/>
-You will have to do this every time you go to GeoFS. <br/>
### Tampermonkey - recommended
-Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) <br/>
-Click [here](https://github.com/geofs-pilot/GeoFS-All-in-one-Addon/raw/main/GeoFS-All-in-one-Addon.user.js) to install the script <br/>
-No need to update, automatically runs latest version <br/>
#### IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1. For Tampermonkey to work, you will have to enable developer mode on the "Manage extensions" page. Also, enable User Scripts in the tampermonkey extension settings. For more info, take a look at Tampermonkey's [FAQ](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?version=5.3.3). <br/>
2. You will be prompted to log in to Puter the first time you use AI ATC. Just click 'Create New Account' and create an account. <br/>
3. You may also have to relaunch the window if Tampermonkey doesn't work immediately. <br/>
